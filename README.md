Yet another .emacs configuration
--------------------------------

My dot emacs configuration: somewhat minimal at the moment. After too
many years, I finally scrapped my crufty emacs code and am slowly
rebuilding my .emacs.d/ again.

Uses both [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and
[el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get).
